<p align="center">A minimap2 frontend for PacBio data:
native PacBio BAM in â‡¨ native PacBio BAM out.</p>

## Availability
The latest pre-release, unstable, experts-only linux/mac binaries can be installed via [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/).

    conda install pbmm2

These binaries are not ISO compliant.
For research only.
Not for use in diagnostics procedures.

No support for source builds.
No support via mail to developers.
Please *do not* contact a PacBio Field Applications Scientist or PacBio Customer Service for assistance.
Please file GitHub issues for problems and questions!

**This is an early beta!** Expect extreme changes and different output between
versions until release of the first stable release.
Furthermore, the command-line options are not stable yet,
and can change at any point, do not rely on it yet.

## Scope
_pbmm2_ is a wrapper for [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2).
Its purpose is to support native PacBio BAM in- and output and provide sets of
recommended parameters. Extensive testing is yet to be performed before _pbmm2_
becomes an officially recommended PacBio aligner; until then, please use BLASR
if you need ISO compliant tools and official PacBio support.:

## Usage
_pbmm2_ offers following tools

```
Tools:
    index      Index reference and store as .mmi file
    align      Align PacBio reads to a reference
```

### Index
Indexing is optional, but recommended it you use the same reference multiple times.
```
Usage: pbmm2 index [options] <ref.fa|xml> <out.mmi>
```

**Notes:**
 - If you use an index file, you can't override parameters `-k` and `-w` in `pbmm2 align`!
 - Minimap2 parameter `-H` (homopolymer-compressed k-mer) is always on.
 - You can also use existing minimap2 `.mmi` files in `pbmm2 align`.

### Align
The output argument is optional. If not provided, BAM output is streamed to stdout.
```
Usage: pbmm2 align [options] <in.subreads.bam|xml> <ref.fa|xml|mmi> [out.aligned.bam|xml]
```

## FAQ
### How can I get sorted alignments for polishing?
```sh
> pbmm2 align movie1.subreadset.xml hg38.mmi | samtools sort > hg38.movie1.sorted.bam
> pbindex hg38.movie1.sorted.bam
```
Do not forget to provide `samtools sort` sufficient number of threads and memory
per thread.

### What are parameter sets and how can I override them?
Per default, _pbmm2_ uses recommended parameter sets to simplify the plethora
of possible combinations. For this, we currently offer:

```
  --preset  Set alignment mode:
             - "SUBREAD" -k 19 -w 10 -d 5 -D 4 -i 56 -I 1 -A 2 -B 5 -z 400 -Z 50 -r 2000
            Default ["SUBREAD"]
```

Prime examples for other parameter sets are
`ISOFORM` or `CCS` mapping; work in progress.

If you want to override any of the parameters of your chosen set,
please use the respective options:

```
  -k   k-mer size (no larger than 28). [-1]
  -w   Minizer window size. [-1]
  -A   Matching score. [-1]
  -B   Mismatch penalty. [-1]
  -d   Deletion gap open penalty. [-1]
  -i   Insertion gap open penalty. [-1]
  -D   Deletion gap extension penalty. [-1]
  -I   Insertion gap extension penalty. [-1]
  -z   Z-drop score. [-1]
  -Z   Z-drop inversion score. [-1]
  -r   Bandwidth used in chaining and DP-based alignment. [-1]
```

If you have suggestions for our default parameters or ideas for a new
parameter set, please open a GitHub issue!

### What about secondary alignments?
We currently only provide primary and supplementary alignments. If you have an
use-case that absolutely needs secondary alignments, please open a GitHub issue!

### I can't find large SVs!
The `--min-accuracy` option, whereas accuracy is defined as

```
    1.0 - (#Deletions + #Insertions + #Mismatches) / MappedReferenceSpan
```

will remove alignments with more unmapped than mapped bases.
You can deactivate this filter with `--min-accuracy 0`.

### Why is the output different from BLASR?
As for any two alignments of the same data with different mappers, alignments
will differ. This is because of many reasons, but mainly a combination of
different scoring functions and seeding techniques.
